# The Academic OSPOCon Review

This repo is the home for notes and takeaways from the informal OSPOCon academic track, focusing especially on conversations which happened as the result of a conversation hosted and organized by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation.

## Format

LaTeX is confusing to use initially, and GitHub is not a great medium for in-time collaboration. So, while the goal of this repository is to be the home for a LaTeX-formatted scientific pre-print which can be submitted on arxiv.org or possibly submitted to an open journal (JOSS? PLoS? Something else?), initially work will happen on the shared Google Doc. Email me if you need a link.
